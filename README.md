# Rust EVM Project

This is a Rust-based Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) implementation. The project demonstrates how to simulate Ethereum smart contract execution using Rust.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/): Make sure you have Rust installed on your system. You can install it using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
- [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/): Cargo is the Rust package manager, and it comes bundled with Rust.

To check if you have Rust and Cargo installed, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version

git clone https://github.com/panjibae/rust_evm.git
cd rust_evm

cargo build
cargo run
